## Overview ðŸ“‹

This project is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to create engaging and visually appealing animations. The HTML file contains the structure of the bouquet, including the flowers, grass, and other elements. The CSS file contains the styling and animations for these elements, using a variety of CSS animations and transforms to bring them to life. The JavaScript file adds an additional layer of interactivity and control, allowing the user to pause and play the animation.
